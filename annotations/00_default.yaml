#
# Default AnnoVEP annotations
#
# Note that while most annotations are defined purely in terms of this YAML file, a
# couple of do rely on post processing in postprocess.py to produce the final output.
#
# Runtimes with annoations are estimated by running AnnoVEP and comparing the runtime
# without any custom annotations with the runtime when just that annotation is enabled.
#

# Annotations built into AnnoVEP. Many of these are generated by AnnoVEP
