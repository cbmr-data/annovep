# Family name. The table produced for this family will include

Family1:
  # "Members" is required and is used to specify what samples
  # are relevant to this family, using more easily read names
  Members:
    # For each member of the family, specify a label ("Mother")
    # and a sample name ("Family1-1"). The label is used in the
    # models below to make models easier to understand.
    Mother:   "Family1-1"
    Father:   "Family1-2"
    Sibling:  "Family1-3"
    Proband:  "Family1-5"

  # "Models" is required and is used to specify what models of
  # inheritance should be tested.
  Models:
    # The name of the model ("Recessive") is written in the
    # output table. The name should not use spaces or any
    # special characters.
    Recessive:
      # The required genotype and one or more sample labels.
      # Here we require that the Proband is homozygous for the
      # alternative allele.
      "1/1": Proband
      # Place sample labels in a list ("[a, b, c]") if more than
      # one sample should have the same genotype.
      "0/1": [Mother, Father]
      # The genotype may be prefixed with an exclamation mark to
      # prohibit that genotype. In other words, this Sibling is
      # allowed to be 0/0 or 0/1.
      "!1/1": Sibling

    # A second model. Any number of models may be specified for
    # each family.
    Denovo:
      "0/1": Proband
      "0/0": [Mother, Father]
      # A question-mark in front of the genotype specifies that
      # the sample is not required to be called. In other words,
      # "?0/0" matches the genotypes "0/0" and "./.".
      "?0/0": Sibling
